A is fireball if you are red mario
B button jumps

Notes:
Mario cannot jump if there is a block above him.
Mario jumps 2 blocks at a time

Mario can stand on blocks but the way to get there is tricky, basically move towards the block as soon as you jump to land on it

Hit boxes are buggy, in general, stay above the enemies and they won't kill you

The fire hitbox is a bit buggy as well, if you find its not killing, try shooting it from slightly below the enemy

The threads are buggy, basically when the level ends the threads finish and new variables are assigned to it. They then restart but the monsters move a lot faster after this happens for some reason

Bullet Bill might become invisible, its a bug we have yet to figure out

To collect powerups, jump onto them

Super Mario is shown by a silver character,
Red Mario is shown by a red character
